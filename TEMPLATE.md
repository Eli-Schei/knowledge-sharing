For inline code use ` `` `. Codeblocks starts and ends with 3 ` ``` `.

```
// This is a comment in a code block
const myVariable = "123";
```
To add syntax highlighting write the language after the first set of ` ```javascript `

```javascript
// This is a comment in a code block with javascript highlighting
const myVariable = "123";
```

You can also use html tags like `<br/>` to create more space.
